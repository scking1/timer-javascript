# Timer

### Description

A simple timer web app with a GUI that allows the user to select the number of hours, minutes, and seconds to start counting down from. The timer can be paused, reset, and once the time reaches zero, an alarm will sound.

I wanted to begin familiarizing myself with JavaScript and the jQuery Library since I will be using both in one of my courses at Fanshawe College in the 2024 fall semester.

One of the challenges I faced with this project was input validation for the user entered time. I decided to use spinners from jQuery UI since I was already familiar with spinners from Java Swing applications.

In the future I'd like to update the UI to something more modern looking and to try a different approach for input validation.  
I'd also like to add an interval feature for exercising but that may require an entirely new project.
